    <p>
      We're a student-run interest group and CTF team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign focused on information security.
      All are welcome! We have a strong focus on kind and collaborative learning.
    </p>


    <p>
    We host weekly public meetings on low-barrier-of-entry security topics that are focused on collaborative learning and friendly environments. 
    In addition, run seminars weekly (mosty) for more in-depth exploration in topics like embedded hacking, penetration testing, and fuzzing research.
